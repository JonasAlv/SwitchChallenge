# SwitchChallenge

- Create a method called printDayOfWeek, that takes an int parameter called day, but doesn't return any values.

- This method will Print the name of the day based on the parameter "day" passed, so that 0 will return "Sunday", 
1 will return "Monday", and so on.

- Any number not between 0 and 6, should return "Invalid Value"(or any other error message).  

- Use enhanced switch statement, traditional switch statement or if-else statement to do this challenge.

- In the main method, call this method for the values 0 through 7.
